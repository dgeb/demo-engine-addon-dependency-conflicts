# ember-cli-addon-guard namespacing demo

This project is based on the [CodeOfficer/demo-engine-addon-dependency-conflicts](https://github.com/CodeOfficer/demo-engine-addon-dependency-conflicts) project, which illustrates a number of issues with dependency conflicts that can occur between apps, engines, and addons.

It illustrates how multiple versions of a single dependency can be shared among apps, engines, and addons, and how ember-cli-addon-guard's namespacing capability can allow these dependencies to co-exist in a single project.

## Installation

This project is a yarn workspace that can be installed simply by running `yarn` from the project root.
